# Neon Cyber AI Visual Templates - Design Notes

This file serves as a placeholder for notes and guidelines regarding the "Neon Cyber AI" visual theme for diagrams and imagery within the "Robotic Nervous System" module.

## Core Elements:

-   **Color Palette**:
    -   Primary: Deep blues (#000033), Electric purples (#660099), Bright neons (cyan, magenta, lime green for accents).
    -   Secondary: Dark grays (#333333) for backgrounds, light grays (#CCCCCC) for subtle text/lines.
-   **Typography**:
    -   Monospaced fonts for code and labels (e.g., Fira Code, Source Code Pro).
    -   Sans-serif for main text (e.g., Montserrat, Lato).
-   **Styling**:
    -   Glow effects for active components, data flow.
    -   Subtle grid patterns or circuitry motifs in backgrounds.
    -   Geometric shapes with sharp edges.
    -   Minimalist icons.

## Excalidraw Specifics:

-   Use custom colors defined above.
-   Ensure consistent line thickness and stroke styles.
-   Group components logically.
-   Add glow effects where applicable for emphasis.

## Examples of elements to template:

-   Nodes (circular or rectangular with glow)
-   Topics (arrows with data labels, possibly glowing)
-   Services (request/response boxes)
-   Connections (lines, arrows, with varying thickness/glow for emphasis)
-   Robot components (simplified geometric forms)

## Guidelines for future diagrams:

-   Maintain consistency in symbology.
-   Diagrams should be clear, even without color, but enhanced by the theme.
-   Export as SVG for scalability and web integration.
