# Quickstart: Module 4 (Vision-Language-Action)

**Prerequisites & Setup Guide**

## 1. Prerequisites
To fully understand this chapter, the reader should have:
*   **Module 1 & 3 Knowledge**: Understanding of ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Nav2 Actions.
*   **Basic AI Literacy**: Understanding of what an LLM (Large Language Model) is (e.g., GPT).
*   **Python Syntax**: Familiarity with function calls and basic logic (if/else).

## 2. Tools Required
*   **None**. This chapter is conceptual.
*   *Optional*: A text editor to "write" sample prompts and see how an LLM might respond.

## 3. Reading Guide
*   **Time Commitment**: ~60 minutes.
*   **Focus Areas**:
    *   **Prompt Engineering**: This is the "programming language" of VLA. Pay attention to how we structure the System Prompt.
    *   **Safety**: Understand *why* we don't let the LLM control motors directly.

## 4. Next Steps
This concludes the technical modules. The book ends with a look at the future of Physical AI.
