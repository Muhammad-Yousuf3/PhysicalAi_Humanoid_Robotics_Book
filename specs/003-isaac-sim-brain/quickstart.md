# Quickstart: Module 3 (The AI-Robot Brain)

**Prerequisites & Setup Guide**

## 1. Prerequisites
To fully understand this chapter, the reader should have:
*   **Conceptual Knowledge**:
    *   Basic understanding of the "Nervous System" (Nodes, Topics) from Module 1.
    *   Basic understanding of "Digital Twins" from Module 2.
*   **Mathematical Context**:
    *   High-level grasp of coordinate frames (X, Y, Z, Roll, Pitch, Yaw).
    *   Basic graph theory (nodes and edges) is helpful but explained in text.

## 2. Tools Required
*   **None**. This chapter is purely conceptual.
*   *Optional*: Access to a computer to view NVIDIA documentation or video tutorials referenced in the text.

## 3. Reading Guide
*   **Time Commitment**: ~45 minutes.
*   **Focus Areas**:
    *   Pay close attention to the **VSLAM** section, as this is the foundation for all robot movement.
    *   Study the **Behavior Tree** diagrams carefully; logic flow is critical for autonomy.

## 4. Next Steps
After this chapter, you will be ready to explore **Module 4**, where we conceptually apply these brains to the physical VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Capstone.
